Once upon a time, in a forest, there lived a monkey who resided on a mango tree, 
which was on the banks on a river. In the same forest there lived a crocodile and his 
wife. One day, the crocodile came to the banks of the river, and rested uner the tree.
The kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits. The crocodile came back the next day
for more fruits, as he loved them. As days passed by, the crocodile and the monkey
became good friends.
